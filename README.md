## What is this?

A really simple express app to make a really simple website about myself. It's also a sandbox for trying out different templating engines and other stuff (note the inclusion of EJS, Jade, and React).

## How to

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

_Note:_ Assumes use of node >= 4.0, as all modules are written in ES6.
